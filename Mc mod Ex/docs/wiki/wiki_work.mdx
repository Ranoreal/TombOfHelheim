## ‚ùì How to Contribute

The wiki is stored on the Mine and Slash github under the doc/ folder.

You can Fork the Mine and Slash github, edit the wiki there and then do a Pull Request

## üìö Rules and Guidelines

1) The Wiki is for understanding Mod mechanics, it is NOT to be used as a database or a list of things inside the mod!

For example, a good wiki page explaining Spells would have 1 or 2 spells to use as examples and explains the mechanics behind mana cost, spell levels etc,
while a bad wiki page would list all the spells in the base mod.

Why is this the first rule?
Because most features of Mine and Slash are datapacks, and modpacks can create new Spells or edit existing spells, and pretty much everything else.

This is why it's not only impossible to keep a list of spells updated, it would be lying to players in 90% of modpacks people play.

In this case, for a list of spells, refer people to the Ingame Library, a feature in the main [H]ub.

2) Focus on teaching how things work, instead of specifics.
This is mostly a rehash of rule 1, but I need to repeat it. The mod changes often, features are reworked, deleted, updated all the time

3) For recipes, refer people to ingame JEI mod

4) Before contributing, remember it's a good idea to come to discord/github and ask something like:
"Hey I want to make some wiki pages for: Spells, level system etc.
I plan to do this and that bla bla"

Then I will tell you if there's any problems with that. For example, maybe the feature you want to document is about to be reworked in a major update.
Or maybe you didn't read the contributor rules and are trying to make a list of all stats.
Maybe you're just curious if something should be documented or best left to ingame library?
Either way, come and ask first!

5) Keep things simple. No complicated code in the wiki, use common components like code blocks, callouts, tables and images.

6) Section things nicely with folders, for example Make an adventure map folder that contains pages like:
- what are maps
- how to run your first map
- completing maps
- league mechanics
etc

If the page ends up being too big, it's good to separate it into a folder of multiple pages, otherwise if it all fits on 1 page (with minimal scrolling), it's fine to keep it on one page.

7) Add proper disclaimers

- If a feature is a datapack:
```
### üì¶ This Feature is a [Datapack](../misc/datapacks)
```

- For every feature that's in the game library, add this:
```
### üìñ Available To Browse in the [Ingame-Library](../misc/ingame_library)
```

Make sure to copy paste these blocks exactly the same so if they're ever changed, we can just replaceall to update them.


---------
Lastly, here's some code blocks that you can reuse in the wiki:

<Callout>
    This can be used as a Tip box, as in hey you might want to know this
</Callout>

-

<Callout variant="danger">
   This is a warning box, do not abuse this. It's for things that we dont want players to do or for very common mistakes people make!
</Callout>
