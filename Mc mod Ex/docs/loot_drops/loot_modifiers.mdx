Note: Loot means both Mine and Slash Experience and Drops.

# All Loot Modifiers:

| Loot Modifier     | Explanation   |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Level Distance Penalty    | Killing mobs way higher or lower level than you adds to the penalty  |
| Anti Mob Farm Mod    | In case it's installed (It's in Most modpacks with Mine and Slash), killing too many mobs in a single chunk reduces loot drops up to 0. The penalty slowly regenerates with time. |
| Vanilla Mob Health    | Mobs with more vanilla hearts have more drops  |
| Mob Datapack    | Specific Mobs can have a loot multiplier specified with datapacks     |
| Dimension Datapack    | Specific Dimensions can have a loot multiplier specified with datapacks     |
| Mob Rarity    | Higher Rarity mobs give more loot    |
| Broken Spawner    | Breaking Spawners gives more loot |
| Player Bonus Exp/Loot Stat    | Players can gain stats that increase loot drops  |
| Favor    | Having a higher favor rank increases loot drops  |
| Map Complete Rarity    |  The Reward room after the boss in adventure maps has more loot per chest depending on your completition rarity rank  |
| Chest    | Chests have more loot in them  |
| Map Chest    | Map Chests have even more loot in them  |

## Typical reasons for no loot drops:
1) Killing mobs with environmental damage - Mobs that mostly die to fire, fall damage etc will drop no loot. To be sure, check if the damage is throwing off Mine and Slash damage number particles.
2) Killing too many mobs in the same place. This triggers the Anti Mob Farm mod penalty.
3) Killing mobs inside a mob grinder (Anti mob farm mod again)
