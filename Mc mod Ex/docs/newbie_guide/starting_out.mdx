## 1) üè† Home sweet Home

Creating a base is the first thing you should do, for a few good reasons:

1) You can keep backups of gear in case of deaths (Fighting mobs naked is nearly impossible after all)

2) You can use a Salvaging Station to get loads of useful materials

3) You can create farms, animal pens, mineshafts etc to level up your professions, which in turn make leveling faster

## 2) ‚öîÔ∏è Killing Mobs

By killing mobs close to your level you will get random loot drops and level up!
These random loot drops are the primary progression mechanism of the mod.
You will get gear, jewels, gems, runes, currencies etc primarily by killing ANY mob!
There's a few caveats though:
- Mob must be near your level (try kill same level or 1-2 level different mobs)
- Mob must be a hostile mob
- You must kill it with Mine and Slash methods, either weapon attacks or MNS Spells
- If mob dies mostly to environmental damage (think lava, fall damage etc, damage that has no player source), you won't get loot/exp
- If you kill too many mobs in a single chunk you will stop getting drops (This is an Anti-Mob-Farm mod feature, but most modpacks with MNS use it)

## 3) ü´° Continue Learning!

Make sure you either read the rest of the wiki or the guides in whatever modpack you're playing!
Mine and Slash is a big and complex mod, but if you know the basics, you can't screw up too badly.
Progression is simple, but optimizing your build and knowing how to efficiently grind gear is the complex part.
