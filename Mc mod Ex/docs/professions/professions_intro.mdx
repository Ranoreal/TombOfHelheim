Professions use separate leveling system and we'll call them profession levels as opposed to combat level.

There are 2 types of professions, Gathering and Crafting!

## Gathering Professions:

| Profession     | How to get Drops/Experience   |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Mining    | Mining Ores (Diamonds, Iron etc)   |
| Farming    | Gathering crops (wheat, carrots etc)   |
| Fishing    | Vanilla Fishing     |
| Animal Breeding    | Breeding any animal  |
| Salvaging    | Salvaging Mine and Slash drops in the Salvaging Station   |

To check what blocks can give experience, use the Ingame-Library.

Salvaging is the only gathering profession that uses its own station!

## Crafting Professions:

| Profession     | What can it create?   |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Gear Crafting    | Gear souls, which allow you to target craft items you need. Also allows the crafting of sharpening stones which improve gear.  |
| Infusing    | Infusions, which add stat boosts to your gear items   |
| Cooking    | Foods that give stat buffs (Note, there are different food types and you can use 1 of each!)    |
| Alchemy    | Potions with stat buffs and health/mana restorative potions |

<Callout variant="danger">
   There's a few common mistakes people with crafting:
</Callout>
- Profession recipes must be crafted in their own stations, not the vanilla crafting table!
- Most recipes require multiple of an item, and JEI only tends to autofill 1 item when clicking the button.
Check that you inserted enough of each item! Example: 1 stone > 10 stones in a stack
- You must first insert the materials, then click the recipe icon that appears, now you can click the craft button

You get Crafting Profession experience by crafting inside their respective stations.

Most recipes use materials from Salvaging. Additionally, gear crafting and infusing also use mining materials.
Some cooking recipes need fishing materials, others need animal breeding materials. Farming mats are also used in alchemy.

  To be sure, check ingame with JEI. In short, level all the professions!
