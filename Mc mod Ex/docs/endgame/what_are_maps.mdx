## What are Maps?

<ModAsset width="75%" location="mmorpg:map_room" />

Maps or Adventure Maps are the primary endgame content where you will fight difficult mobs, bosses and even uber bosses!
It's a separate dimension full of infinite random dungeons!
There are many different dungeon themes to explore, most of them have hidden chests, some even have puzzles!

## How do I get maps?

To get your first map, just craft the Map Creator.
Right click it and you'll get a random Common map.

After that, completing maps will allow you to get a new map with a higher rarity (if it's already not maximum rarity).
The only requirement is to kill the boss inside the map.
To get to the boss, you need to complete a certain percentage of the map by killing mobs and looting chests.

## How do I enter a map?

Craft a Map Device, place it and right click it with an Adventure Map.
You can now right click the device to enter the map.

## The map is too difficult!!

If the map is too difficult, you could instead downgrade the rarity of the map instead of upgrading it.
You can also improve your build, get better gear or watch out for the dangerous affixes better!
If you're a Fire mage and the map has a -50% less fire damage done by players affix, you should probably avoid it if you're weak.
