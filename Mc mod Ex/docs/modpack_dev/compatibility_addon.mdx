# What is the Compatibility Addon?

This addon exist to switch Mine and Slash from a mostly incompatible mod that a modpack has to revolve around into a very compatible mod that can be placed in any modpack.
If you're confused why this is a thing, read on

# What are the differences between the 3 modes?

Compatible mode is just Original mode but with other mod's spell damage being converted to Mine and Slash damage.

Lite mode is a bit more drastic in changes, read on:

| Difference | Lite Mode    | Original Mode   |
|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
|  Damage   | Damage is added on top of vanilla damage as bonus damage | Damage is overrided/replaced and if the damage is invalid type, it is cancelled |
| Stat Scaling | Very Low stat scalings, you won't gain that much health, damage etc, but mobs won't either | Very high stat scaling, mob health will be in millions in endgame |
| Spell Cast Weapon | No weapon requirement for spells | Spells have weapon requirements |
| Vanilla Health Regen | Enabled plus you have mns health regen stat | Replaced with Mns health regen stat |
| Mob Damage | Mobs get a slight amount of bonus damage | Mobs get a lot of extra damage |


# What Mode is best for me?

If you are making a modpack focusing entirely on Mine and Slash, then you don't need to install the addon:
- this mode makes sure you can kill mobs only with damage Mine and slash allows, so you only need to balance mine and Slash
- you don't have to worry about the balance of other mods, whether they add a single OP item, spell etc
- because only mns deals damage, balancing becomes easier
- Stat scalings are higher, so leveling matters a lot more and it feels more like an rpg

If your modpack doesn't revolve around Mine and Slash, an you have other spell mods in there, you should install the compatibility addon:
- Your other spell mods will work [Compatible or Lite mode]
- Mine and Slash will no longer be required for progression and to kill mobs (depends on stat scalings) [Lite mode]
- the gui overlays bars will try hide when full or not needed [Lite mode]

# Where can I tweak the settings?

save_folder/serverconfig/mine_and_slash_compatibility-server.toml

# How Do I balance multiple spell/rpg mods with Mine and Slash?

Well by installing the Compatibility Addon you kinda brought this problem on yourself, but I'll try provide some ideas:
- reduce mana regen massively for every spell mod. This way you will need to use spells from all mods to kill stuff.
