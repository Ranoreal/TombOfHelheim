## Mine and Slash Commands

All Mns commands are under /mine_and_slash

## Useful commands:

* /mine_and_slash give - lots of different options like giving yourself gear, unique gear, support gems etc
* /mine_and_slash set level - setting your level to 100 allows easy testing of talents and spells etc
* /mine_and_slash stat give exact - giving yourself stats is useful for testing how those stats work
* /mine_and_slash report map_bug - if you find a bug in an adventure map, using this command near the bug (like a broken command block etc) gives you a copy pasta to report with
* /mine_and_slash list_stat_sources - lets you know where you got a stat from. Don't know why you have high crit chance? Oh it's from your talents!
* /mine_and_slash points - for giving yourself various points (spell, talent points etc), this is usually not needed but maybe you want more points than lvl 100 gives you


## Common Confusion points

- If some command asks for a guid and has no dropdown of things to select, just call it any name.
- If the command has a dropdown of things to select, you most likely have to select one of them, if the thing doesn't auto complete, it means it doesn't exist, example: stat ids
- Read the command errors and popups, make sure you typed out ALL the fields!
