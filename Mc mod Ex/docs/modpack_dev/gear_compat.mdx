## What is Gear Compatiblity?

Gear Compat in Mine and Slash means the gear being able to have a soul.
Souls are a way of saying the item has mine and slash gear stats.

## Do I need to add Compat for X Items?

If the items are: armor, curio ring/necklace then they will be instantly compatible.
If they are weapons, read on.

## How do I make an item Compatible?

This assumes the item is of a type that already exists, for example, Vanilla swords become mine and slash sword item types.
To make these items compatible (in case the auto-compat didn't work), you just have to either:
1) add them to server config's compat item list
2) Create an mmorpg:slot tag datapack with them inside

## What if the item type doesn't exist?

If it's a simple melee weapon, you can just use an existing weapon type like Sword and just ignore the funny item being a scythe but named a sword.
If you find that horrible, read on:

If you say have a Scythe weapon and want to give it a scythe item type, you have to actually create the datapacks needed:
- mmorpg_base_gear_types
- mmorpg_gear_slot
- mmorpg_weapon_type (Decides what is a valid attack, for melee weapons that's player attack, for bows that's an arrow hit)

These names are currently confusing and need renaming, but anyway some examples:

Plate chestplate is a mmorpg_base_gear_types of chest mmorpg_gear_slot

Sword is a mmorpg_base_gear_types of sword mmorpg_gear_slot with sword mmorpg_weapon_type

As you notice, some items like chestplates have different base gear types, cloth, plate, leather.
But items like swords have just 1 type for their slot.

## I made a weapon and it's ingame but the attacks don't do damage correctly!

That means your mmorpg_weapon_type datapack is falsely configured.
You need to find out how the weapon deals damage and add that correctly to the mmorpg_weapon_type datapack.
This can be done by checking the mod github code of the weapon you're using and seeing how it deals damage.
(A feature to check this ingame might be created in the future if people want it)

It's possible to just allow any damage to trigger weapon hits, but you probably don't want your bazooka to deal weapon damage on snowball hits right?
That's why you should try make it specific so ONLY that weapon can actually trigger the hits.
