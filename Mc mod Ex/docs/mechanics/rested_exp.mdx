# What's Rested Experience?

Rested Exp is a mechanic that gives you bonus exp.
If you say have 200 rested exp, that means while you gain exp in the future, you will slowly spend your rested exp to gain that much bonus exp.

# How Do I get Rested Exp?

You can currently get it in 1 way only:
- Doing Professions like mining or gear crafting etc will give you Rested Combat Exp, which then makes you gain bonus exp when you kill mobs
- Killing mobs gives you rested Profession Exp, which will give you bonus exp when you later do professions

It purely exists to reward doing professions while leveling!
